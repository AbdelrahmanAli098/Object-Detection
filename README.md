# 🚗 YOLOv8 Object Detection — Learning Notebook

This notebook explores how **YOLOv8** works by running **pretrained model inference** on images from a Kaggle self-driving car dataset.  
The goal is to understand the basics of object detection, including bounding boxes, confidence scores, and detected classes.

---

## 📌 What This Notebook Covers
- Loading YOLOv8 pretrained model (`yolov8s.pt`)
- Running inference on sample road-scene images
- Visualizing detected objects (cars, pedestrians, signs, etc.)
- Extracting predictions such as:
  - Class name  
  - Confidence  
  - Bounding box coordinates  

No training or fine-tuning was performed.  
This project focuses only on **learning YOLO inference** and understanding how object detection models work.
